# Project Plan: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Preference-Aligned Language Models

## High-Level Concept
You create a **multi-agent environment** where multiple LLM-based agents interact to solve tasks, but each agent’s behavior is tuned using **RLHF-style preference learning**.  

- One “agent” will be your *target model* that’s learning.  
- Another will be a *critic/evaluator agent* that provides “human-like” preference feedback.  
- Additional agents can act as *collaborators or competitors*, creating **non-stationarity** in the training signal — a key MARL challenge.

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ RLHF (post-training LLM improvement)
- ✅ Multi-agent RL (non-stationary, game-theoretic elements)
- ✅ Agentic AI orchestration (autonomous multi-role agents)

## Architecture Overview

**Agents:**
1. **Learner Agent (LA)** — A small, fine-tunable LLM (e.g., LLaMA-2-7B, Phi-3-mini, or Mistral-7B) trained via PPO to improve on tasks.
2. **Judge Agent (JA)** — Another LLM or rule-based evaluator that scores or gives preference feedback between LA’s outputs and a baseline.
3. **Context Agents (CA)** — Other LLMs or scripted bots that the LA interacts with (could be cooperative or adversarial).

**Training Loop:**
1. **Task Generation** — CAs create a problem or interact in a game environment.
2. **Response Generation** — LA produces an answer/strategy.
3. **Preference Collection** — JA compares LA’s output to a reference (baseline or competing agent) and gives a preference signal.
4. **RL Optimization** — Use PPO to fine-tune LA’s policy to maximize preference reward.

## Environment & Task Ideas

Choose something tractable but non-trivial:
- **Negotiation Game** — multi-agent bargaining; JA scores fairness & coherence.
- **Collaborative Story Writing** — agents build a narrative; JA scores consistency & creativity.
- **Code Debugging Task** — one agent writes buggy code, another fixes it; JA scores correctness.
- **Knowledge Retrieval Challenge** — agents find & synthesize facts; JA scores relevance.

## Technical Stack

- **Base Models:**  
  - LLaMA-2-7B / Phi-3-mini for LA  
  - GPT-4o-mini (API) or smaller open-source model for JA
- **RLHF Training:**  
  - [TRL](https://github.com/huggingface/trl) (HuggingFace’s transformers + PPO) — supports preference-based fine-tuning.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:**  
  - [`langgraph`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) or [`autogen`](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) for message-passing between agents.
- **Environment:**  
  - Custom Python framework using OpenAI Gym-like `step()` interface.

## Milestones

1. **Week 1-2 — RLHF Pipeline Basics**  
   - Train LA on a single-agent text generation task using preference data from JA.  
   - Validate PPO setup works and improves performance.

2. **Week 3-4 — Multi-Agent Integration**  
   - Add CAs and create interactive environment.  
   - Introduce non-stationarity (CAs change strategies).  

3. **Week 5 — Evaluation Framework**  
   - Implement automatic metrics: win rate, preference score, task success rate.  

4. **Week 6 — Experiments & Report**  
   - Compare single-agent RLHF vs. multi-agent RLHF performance.  
   - Analyze how non-stationarity impacts learning stability.

## Final Deliverables

- **Open-source repo** with training scripts, environment code, and evaluation tools.  
- **Technical blog post / Medium article**: “Teaching AI Agents to Work Together (and Compete) via RLHF.”  
- **Slide deck** summarizing research question, method, results, and relevance to IBM’s AI direction.  
- Optional: submit to **NeurIPS Workshop on Multi-Agent Learning** or **ICLR RLHF workshop**.
